                My name is Abenezer Benniame. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, 
                and I'm a rising sophomore at CRLS (Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school). 
                My favorite class are science and math. I am currently in E1T1 because 
                I'm working for the Cambridge Mayor's Youth Summer Employment Program (MYSEP). 
                I'm in E1T1 to gain knowledge and learn new thing skills. 
                A fun fact about me is I'm the oldest in the family. My hobbies are playing basketball. 
                I also like to workout in the gym because I want to stay strong and healthy. In my free time, 
                I like to play video games.</p>
